# Hi, I'm Andres 🤟

  ## what i'm building

  running an experiment: can one person + AI build real companies?

  **Brainz Lab** - AI-native infrastructure. logs, errors, APM, feature flags. self-hosted, open source. giving AI the eyes it needs to actually run things.
  → [brainzlab.ai](https://brainzlab.ai) | [github.com/brainz-lab](https://github.com/brainz-lab)

  **LexPro** - legal management for LATAM. built 100% with Claude. real product, real users.
  → [lex-pro.co](https://lex-pro.co)

  ## the experiment

  i want a "morning ritual" - check in, make decisions, AI handles the rest.

  product development. deployments. support. operations.

  not AI-assisted. AI leading.

  building in public. let's see how far this goes.

  ## background

  13+ years building software. rails since 2012. led teams, built ERPs, scaled platforms across LATAM.

  now: one founder. AI team. multiple products.

  the best code builders are great readers and writers. that's what this is really about.
